                                Kamalia is well reputed all over the country as well as the world for its special handmade cloth known as <b>Khaddar</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                KAMALIA KHADDI had its humble beginning in the 90's. KAMALIA KHADDI was one of the pioneers who introduced state of the art machinary at that time.
                                We started providing Khaddar locally at initial stages. As the business grew gradually we expanded on an nationalwide level and then beyond borders.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lack of availability of high quality Khaddar and retail outlests, Khaddar market being concentrated only in Kamalia, our customer across the country requested
                                an easier way of buyinh khaddar. Keeping customer service at heart and the customer satisfaction on our top priority we decided to have online presence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To distinguish ourselves from rest of the market our online collection only has <b>top quality</b> khaddar which
                                comes with super-fast free and secured delivery with cash on delivery as well as other payment options.
